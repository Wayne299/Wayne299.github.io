Occupation, the foundation of a quality life, has aroused discussions and even debates over the preferable choices of it. Some people may argue that a less rewarding but secure job should be prioritized. Others, however, claim that it is reasonable for people to chase on careers with high salaries though at the risk of losing them. In my opinion, locating careers with high salaries tends to have a more favorable influence.

Pursuing a high-paid career is one of the powerful determinant of the quality of life. The more money one earned from his careers and positions, the more likely his daily necessaries, such as acquisition of luxuries, frequent vacations and wholesome food, can translate into high life satisfaction, which in turn promote the behavior at work in a straightforward manner. In addition, with quantities of money earned and collected, one can provide constant and continuous medical care for his older parents and a first-class education for his children. How can an impoverished adult guarantee well-being of his family? Among employees, with decent careers, is my uncle from Google. Earning 13000 dollars per month, he bought a BMW automobile for himself. What's more, each month, he and his family members visit Europe on a regular basis. Never could a person with a less rewarding careers achieve these.

What should be equally worth discussing is that the chances of losing a job can be easily reduces and decreased. Initially, never should we ignore the significance of boosting and enhancing productivity to secure a career. In detail, only via reducing time allocated to distractions or interruptions, impairing efficiency, and committing fewer mistakes, can we utilized to maximize profits and therefore, lower the risks of losing career. Moreover, it is beneficial and advantageous to stable occupations to maintain and strengthen an intimate bond with supervisors. To be more specific, bosses function as a determinant in one's career security, a harmonious and intimate relationship with whom can win favor and appreciation, and eventually, contribute to a stable career. A survey conducted by Harvard University, aiming to discover the effect of high efficiency and strong connection on the stability of positions, suggests that they can exert positive influences. According to an interviewee, if he did not increasing his productivity by accomplishing two crucial projects efficiently and effectively within certain time period, he could lose his decent positions in Facebook, a prestigious organization. Furthermore, by engaging himself into genuine communications and interactions with his leaders, he ensured a stable occupation.

In conclusion, from what has been discussed above, a well-paid vocation, the objective everyone strives for, benefits people in many respects. Possibilities of losing careers, as illustrated in one working in Airbnb, can be reduced to some extent. In my perspective, it is more feasible for them to chase a rewarding job.
